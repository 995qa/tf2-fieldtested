# TF2: Field Tested

TF2:FT is a mod for TF2 which is planned to add new weapons and revert some weapons.
I have reverted the following weapons:

Baby Face Blaster

Backburner

Bushwacka

Razorback

Tribalman's Shiv

Some weapons have some stats reverted, but some stats stay:

Spycicle (Now has Silent Killer)

Weapons I may add:


## Fast-Thrower (Pyro) (to-do)

+30% Flame Velocity

+30% Damage

-50% Afterburn time

+100% Airblast cost

+20% Ammo cost


## Kalashnikov (Sniper) (implemented, need to change backpack icon)

(Comparing to Sniper SMG)

+100% damage

-25% bullet spread

+25% reload time

-15 Health

No random crits

## Crowbar (All-Class) (implemented, need to fix backpack icon)

Reskin of the Frying Pan


## If you have any weapon ideas, dm me

# Credits

I'm not an animator or modeler, so I have used the following mod's assets for this:

[TF2 All-Class Crowbar (SFM Beta version)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/198771)

SilentFox3 did texture/model edits to the crowbar found in the SFM Beta leak and also re-rigged it.

[AK47](https://gamebanana.com/mods/197796)

I used the model and textures to make the AK.
