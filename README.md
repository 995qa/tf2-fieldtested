# TF2: Field Tested

TF2:FT is a mod for TF2 that adds new weapons and convars.

# Credits

I'm not an animator or modeler, so I have used the following mod's assets for this:

[TF2 All-Class Crowbar (SFM Beta version)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/198771)

SilentFox3 did texture/model edits to the crowbar found in the SFM Beta leak and also re-rigged it.

[AK47](https://gamebanana.com/mods/197796)

I used the model and textures to make the AK.
